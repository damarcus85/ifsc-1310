        <h2>Dragon Vehicle Overview:</h2>
        <p><
        
            <h2>Configurations:</h2>

            <ul>Cargo - Resupply the Space Station</ul>

            

            <li>* VERSATILE CARGO RACKS - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment. They accommodate a variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological samples.</li>

            <h3>Crews Taking Humans into Space</h3>

            <li>* PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA - Dragon was designed from the outset to fly humans to space. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is making upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew carrying capability.
            </li>

                <li>* CREW UPGRADES - Dragon will be the world's safest and most reliable crew transport vehicle, with seating for seven, life-support systems, controls with manual capability, and a powered launch escape system.</ul>
<li>* FIRST LAUNCH - Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. Dragonâ€™s first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.</ul>

<h3>Dragon Lab - A FREE-FLYING MICROGRAVITY LABORATORY</h3>
<li>* FACILITATING RESEARCH - DragonLab is a free-flying, unmanned platform designed for research and testing in a microgravity environment independent of the International Space Station.</li>
<li>* LONGEVITY - It can transport payloads, experiments, instruments, and sensors into space and back to Earth on missions ranging from one week to two years.</li>
<li> CAPABILITIES - DragonLab can readily accommodate instrument and sensor testing, space physics and relativity experiments, radiation effects research, and many other microgravity tests.</li>
