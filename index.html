    <h2>Dragon Project Revision & Reflection</h2>
    <p>I had the privilege of working with a peer the last few weeks of class, and while it started as a collaborative effort for another assignment I was able to get some feedback surrounding my Dragon project.   During his first review of my HTML code he pointed out that I had potentially created more work for myself by not using the “Starter HTML” Mr. Wallace provided on his website.  He mentioned that as I began to attempt styling my HTML in CSS that I would run into issues requiring me to include several different selectors just to style a single element.  The mere thought of this gave me anxiety, considering I hadn’t validated any of my code.  Turns out, because he’d used the “starter html” he was just a little overwhelmed by how convoluted my HTML looked at first glance.  Since he couldn’t help me much with my styling needs, my 1 on 1 with Mr. Wallace was more informative and productive.  One simple issue that I could not figure out with my peer regarding my banner wallpaper was easily resolved with a glance from, Mr. Wallace, and him discovering that I left the “box-sizing” element  out of my stylesheet.
      Once I validated my HTML, it didn’t return any errors which was rather relieving.
      </p>
      <p>I decided to keep  my webpage fairly simple, as I still find myself struggling a tad to fully understand some of the fundamentals of web development and design and what specific elements are most effective in a Web Developers design choice.  There’s a lot of information to look at and one of the most helpful pieces of criticism I recently received was to ensure I separate my line(s) of code for easy viewing.  To my peers' point, my HTML was a little hard to read, and I often found myself just staring at my screen in an attempt to find where I started and where I ended.  There’s quite a bit of information we take in each class, and what I am finding is that constant use of these learned principles is necessary to retain what we learn in each class.  There were moments during my project development where I I had to reference material from third-party sources or course materials in order to recall how to properly configure my HTML and my CSS.  Target selectors, specificity, and their syntax seem to be somewhat confusing at times.   I know the more I utilize these methods the better I’ll get.  However, it was this initial project and some of the efforts made to target specific elements that I found myself growing slightly frustrated with elements not behaving the way I wanted or at all for that matter. </p>
  <p>As this is my first semester, and the first time I’ve ever had any exposure to HTML and my ability to make it behave as I desire, I know I’ll get better with time.  While the learning sessions are fairly fast paced, I now realize that you absolutely must be driven outside of the classroom and course material to solidify your understanding of the principles we’ll learn in & out of class.  With unlimited resources and opportunities to “get my hands dirty” I trust my confidence will increase, as sometimes I’d find myself questioning whether or not I truly understood what was being taught.  I know this lack of confidence is common when taking on a new subject, but with continued self-practice and learning opportunities in the coming semesters I trust I’ll be just fine.</p>
